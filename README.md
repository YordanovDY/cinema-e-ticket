## Technologies Used
- Frontend: Angular 18
- Backend & Database: Back4App
- Authentication: Session Token

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Angular 18 installed.
- APP ID, REST API KEY

### Installation
1. Install dependencies (npm i);
2. Navigate to src / environments;
3. Create a file named keys.ts in environments folder with the following structure:

export const APP_ID = '';
export const  REST_API_KEY = '';

where the values should be your APP ID and REST API KEY.

4. Run the application (ng serve);

## Some users for testing:

### User Role
- username: Dido1
- password: qwerty

### Manager Role
- username: bobi11
- password: qwerty

### Admin Role
- username: Administrator
- password: qwerty

## Found Bugs
- Upon login or registration, the router occasionally fails to redirect to the home page. As a result, users must manually navigate to http://localhost:4200. If the Login and Register buttons still appear, repeat the process until a circular button with the first letter of your username is displayed, indicating successful login.
